0.12 (2015/01/26)
    (ms) [rt.cpan.org #100789] http_loop() now returns a HTTP::Response 
         object even in the error case, to allow for the is_error() 
         method to work in the calling code.
    (ms) [rt.cpan.org [#101655] fixed docs, removed unused config_file 
         parameter in constructor.

0.11 (2014/10/08)
    (ms) Ilmari Ikonen implemented file_delete(). Added docs and tests.
    (ms) Failed calls no longer die, but return undef, where $gd->error()
         holds an error message.
    (ms) Added access_type=offline ([rt.cpan.org #99372]) since Google
         apparently won't sent a refresh token in some cases if it's not
         set.

0.10 (2014/09/27)
    (ms) Fixed file_upload(), which uses the token_expire() method
         in OAuth::Cmdline 0.03.

0.09 (2014/09/25)
    (ms) Fixed link to set up client ID and secret, as suggested by 
         Tom Shield ([rt.cpan.org #94316]).

         trashed items.

         * Allow passing of the Google JSON file on the command line, 
           and using the data found in the JSON file as credentials
         * Output an error message if the user did not patch the file, and 
           also did not pass the JSON file on the command line
         * Try to find the JSON file in the users home directory
         * a new search() method to perform non-folder-based general 
           searches for files
    (ms) Maettu documented exporting Google Docs
         (https://github.com/mschilli/net-google-drive-simple/pull/7)
